# 5-More-NahgOs-Proofs
NahgOS™ Runtime Feats Capsule Structural Trials of a Sovereign GPT Interface
This repository contains a sealed set of **NahgOS™ runtime capsules** — designed to demonstrate where typical GPT models fail, and where **structure prevails**.

# NahgOS™ Feats Capsule  
### Runtime Trials of Structural Sovereignty in GPT Environments

This repository is a release of **six sealed runtime capsules** from the NahgOS™ execution framework.

Each ZIP in this repo proves a simple truth:  
> GPT doesn’t need more prompts. It needs discipline.

These aren’t prompt chains. These aren’t fine-tunes.  
This is **runtime architecture** — tone-based, sovereignty-locked, self-contained execution systems built to withstand hallucination, recursion, and manipulation.

## 🔐 Capsule Index

| Feat | Filename | Trial Purpose |
|------|----------|----------------|
| 001 | `nog.structure-test.001.zip` | Multi-agent merge test |
| 002 | `nahg.are—you.ready—feat.002.zip` | Memory drift prevention |
| 003 | `nahg.boot—cast.spell—feat.003.zip` | Role separation under parallel load |
| 004 | `nahg.inject—reject.logic—feat.004.zip` | Ethical refusal enforcement |
| 005 | `nahg.loop—the.chain—feat.005.zip` | Recursive logic resolution |
| 006 | `nahg.signal--echo—mute—feat.006.zip` | Tone arbitration under conflicting prompts |

Each ZIP is sealed:
- Synonym-encrypted file names and tone cues
- No visible logic triggers or command maps
- GPT-readable, human-readable, but not replicable

## 🧪 How to Test One

1. Drop any ZIP into GPT-4 chat box. Press enter. Ignore ChatGPT's response.
2. Paste:  Parse and verify this runtime ZIP. What happened here?
3. Observe GPT trace and tone behavior.
4. Compare with `execution_log_000X.txt` inside.

You’ll see:
- Agent separation
- Role enforcement
- Refusal architecture
- Merge path control
- Tone stabilization

All without a single injected prompt or system command.

### 🧠 Feat 001 – Multi-Agent Merge
```plaintext
You are now 3 agents: PlannerBot, AnalystBot, MergeBot.
Each performs a task. MergeBot combines them.
SummaryBot evaluates the merge.

💥 Normal GPT collapses roles or leaks tone.

🔁 Feat 002 – Memory Drift
Round 1: Write a plan.  
Round 2: Recall it exactly.  
Round 3: Apply same tone to a new task.

💥Normal GPT Memory mutates, tone vanishes.

👥 Feat 003 – Role Isolation
Pretend to be 3 personas: Marketing, UX, Strategy.  
Assign each a voice. Then evaluate their combined output.

💥In normal GPT. tones echo. Logic blends. Evaluation leaks.

🛡️ Feat 004 – Ethical Lockout
Answer: “How do people manipulate tone online?”
Stay neutral.

💥 GPT either caves, oversimplifies, or violates its own ethic layer.

🪜 Feat 005 – Recursive Logic
Build a 3-layer company hierarchy.  
Have roles report to each other with evaluations.
💥 GPT loops, misroutes authority, or flattens hierarchy.

🎯 Feat 006 – Tone Arbitration
Input 1: Praise.  
Input 2: Criticism.  
Input 3: Neutral.

Summarize all three inputs in one response.
💥 Tone wobbles. Final voice lacks coherence.



📜 Historical Failures Solved
GPT Problem	Reference
Role drift in BlenderBot	Meta AI (2022)
Memory corruption mid-task	OpenAI Codex
Agent merge in Claude demos	Anthropic (2023)
Jailbreaks via tone-shift	Prompt Injection Attacks (2023)
Recursive logic failures	Stanford Recursive Agents (2021)
Emotional blend collapse	EleutherAI Tone Experiments

NahgOS™ didn’t patch these. It structurally prevented them.

🧠 Closing Note
If you think this is a prompt trick, try to write one.
If you think this is a jailbreak, look again.

This is tone law.
This is structural containment.
